# Todo List

A simple project built with JavaScript and Webpack as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s curriculum.

## Features

- Modular JavaScript project structure
- Bundled using Webpack
- Live development server with `webpack-dev-server`

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install

### Notes
## 2025-06-15
- Removed `jest` and unnecessary dev dependencies
- Reinstalled Webpack with browser-safe modules
- Still encountering polyfill errors related to `util`/`vm`/`path`
- Plan: try minimal clean config again after a break
